# React Authentication & Map Integration App

This project is a full-stack React application that includes secure authentication, a dashboard, and an interactive map using an open-source mapping library like Leaflet or OpenLayers. The application is powered by a Node.js backend with Express, implementing JWT-based authentication to protect API routes. The dashboard displays dynamic card components, and clicking on a card navigates users to the map view, which focuses on India with zoom functionality. The frontend is built using React class components, React Router for navigation, and Fetch API or Axios for API requests. The UI is styled using Material UI, Bootstrap, or Styled Components, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

To set up the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start both the backend and frontend servers. The backend provides three primary API endpoints: `/login` for user authentication, `/dashboard` for retrieving dashboard data, and `/map` for fetching map configurations. All protected routes require a valid JWT token, which is generated upon login and stored in local storage or cookies. The authentication workflow ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, enhancing security. 

Users begin by logging in with valid credentials to receive a JWT token. Upon authentication, they are redirected to the dashboard displaying multiple cards. Clicking a card navigates them to the map view, where they can explore the map with zoom in and zoom out features. The application ensures seamless interaction between components while maintaining a secure authentication flow. Future enhancements may include role-based authentication, additional map features like markers and layers, and further UI/UX refinements.
